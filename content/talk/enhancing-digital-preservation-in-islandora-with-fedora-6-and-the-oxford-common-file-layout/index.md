title: Enhancing Digital Preservation in Islandora with Fedora 6 and the Oxford
  Common File Layout
abstract: >-
  Fedora 6, the next major version of Fedora, will focus on digital preservation
  by aligning with the Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL), an
  application-independent approach to the storage of digital objects in a
  structured, transparent, and predictable manner.
   
  This session will provide an overview of Fedora 6, including a brief introduction to the OCFL and how it will enhance support for digital preservation in Islandora. We will also provide a summary of development progress to date and the anticipated timeline for the 6.0 release.
