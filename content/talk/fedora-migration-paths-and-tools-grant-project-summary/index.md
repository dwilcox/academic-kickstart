title: "Fedora Migration Paths and Tools: Grant Project Summary"
abstract: >-
  The DuraSpace Community Supported Programs division at LYRASIS will undertake
  an 18-month project to develop, pilot, and document tools and paths to migrate
  from Fedora 3.x to Fedora 6.x (and beyond). The project is the result of a
  year-long planning effort funded by IMLS National Leadership Grant
  LG-72-18-0204-18, which investigated barriers to migrations and upgrades at
  institutions running older versions of Fedora.
   
  Through two in-depth pilots, LYRASIS and the Fedora community will produce tools, documentation, paths, case studies, and best practices to support and improve the migration process for Fedora 3 repositories. This presentation will provide an overview of the project plan and discuss related work that is already happening to support the migration effort.
